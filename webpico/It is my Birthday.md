Our goal in this challenge is to produce 2 pdfs with the same `MD5 hash` which is possible by exploiting the hashing function which results in `MD5 Collision`  
  
Pulling an example form the web - [Article by Peter Selinger demonstrating MD5 Collision](https://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/md5collision/)  
uploading the files to the site (after changing the ext form `.exe` to `.pdf` as only pdfs are accepted and we aren't bother about its readabiliy) 
reveals the flag
