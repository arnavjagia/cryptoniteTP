the name hints that it has something to do with cookies.  
on inspecting we find a cookie literally named `name` with default value `-1`.  
entering the prompt `snickerdoodle` and hitting the search button changes `name` val to `0`.  
So,  
trying out different values of the cookie `name` till the flag is revealed,  
we obtain the flag for `name` set to `18`.
