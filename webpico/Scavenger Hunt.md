the website talks about the use of html, css and js  
inspecting html gives the first part

and the js has a comment `How can I keep Google from indexing my website?`  
referring this [Google Search Console Help answer](https://support.google.com/webmasters/thread/123127781/how-to-block-site-from-indexing-in-google-search-engine?hl=en) talked about `robots.txt` file (tough that is not where you would ideally go to block a page from crawling)  
<br>anyways, that gives part 3
![flag3](https://github.com/arnavjagia/cryptoniteTP/assets/89345926/474627d6-e262-4fec-a349-97ec9e13068b)  

Now it Says its an apache server  
looked it up and apparently there are files like `.htaccess` file which is a config file that allows custom behaviour for a specific folder in terms of web properties  
accessing that give part 4

the hint to developing on mac whilst talking about additional storage refers to `.DS_Store` file which in a mac file structure stores all info  
accessing it gives part 5
